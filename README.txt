PROJECTS

2D ACTION PLATFORMER GAME
My current project is a 2D action platformer game. The game features challenging enemies and a linear story.
Players will navigate through levels filled with obstacles and enemies, utilizing various weapons and abilities to defeat them.
The game is being developed using Godot.

TEXT-BASED GAME
I have completed a text-based game that I submitted in my class.
The game features a storyline to save your wife in another universe but before teleporting in another universe you need to collect item and defeat the boss.
I used Python to develop the game.
